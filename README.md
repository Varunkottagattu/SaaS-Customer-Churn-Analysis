# SaaS-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Executive-level SaaS dashboard built with Power Pivot and DAX to analyze retention and revenue health.
# SaaS Executive Command Center: Revenue & Churn Diagnostics

## Project Overview
This project features an advanced business intelligence dashboard designed to monitor the health of a subscription-based (SaaS) business. It moves beyond basic data reporting into **Diagnostic Analytics**, identifying where and why customer churn is occurring.

## Key Features & Technical Skills
* **Advanced Data Modeling:** Developed a relational model in **Power Pivot** to handle 160+ transaction records.
* **DAX Logic (Data Analysis Expressions):** Authored complex measures including:
  * **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):** Using `CALCULATE` and `SUM`.
  * **Churn Rate %:** Calculated as `[Churned Customers] / [Total Customers]`.
* **Interactive UI/UX:** Built a high-contrast "Dark Mode" interface with synchronized **Slicers** and **Report Connections**.
* **KPI Integration:** Implemented threshold-based **Traffic Light KPIs** to provide instant visual status alerts on revenue targets.
